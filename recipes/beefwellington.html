    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>Beef Wellington is a classic British dish that consists of a tender beef fillet (usually coated with a layer of pâté or mushroom duxelles) that is encased in puff pastry and baked until golden brown. The dish is often flavored with herbs and sometimes wrapped in slices of prosciutto or parma ham before being wrapped in the pastry. The result is a delicious, luxurious, and indulgent entrée that combines the rich flavors of beef with the buttery, flaky goodness of puff pastry. It's typically served in thick slices and is often accompanied by a rich mushroom sauce or red wine reduction. Beef Wellington is known for its elegant presentation and is a popular choice for special occasions and holiday dinners.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Beef Fillet</li>
        <li>Puff Pastry</li>
        <li>Mushroom Duxelles</li>
        <li>Prosciutto or Parma Ham</li>
        <li>Egg Wash</li>
        <li>Seasonings</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prep the Beef</strong> - Season the beef fillet with salt and pepper. You can optionally sear the beef in a hot pan with a little oil for a minute or two on each side to give it a nice crust. Allow it to cool.</li>
        <li><strong>Wrap the Beef </strong> - Optionally, lay out a sheet of plastic wrap and place slices of prosciutto or Parma ham on it. Spread the mushroom duxelles evenly over the prosciutto. Place the seared (or uncooked) beef fillet on top of the duxelles. Wrap the prosciutto and duxelles around the beef, creating a neat package. Use the plastic wrap to help shape it if needed. Chill the wrapped beef in the refrigerator for about 15-30 minutes to firm it up.</li>
        <li><strong>Roll Out the Puff Pastry </strong> - Roll out the puff pastry on a lightly floured surface to a size that will fully encase the beef when wrapped.</li>
        <li><strong>Wrap the Beef in Pastry </strong> - Remove the beef from the plastic wrap and place it in the center of the rolled-out puff pastry. Fold the pastry over the beef, ensuring it's tightly sealed, and trim any excess pastry if necessary. Seal the edges by pressing them with your fingers or using the tines of a fork.</li>
        <li><strong>Egg Wash and Decorate </strong> - Brush the entire pastry with an egg wash (beaten egg) for a golden finish. You can also create decorative patterns on the pastry with a knife.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake</strong> - Place the Beef Wellington on a baking sheet or in an ovenproof dish. Preheat your oven to around 375-400°F (190-200°C) and bake the Beef Wellington for about 35-45 minutes, or until the pastry is golden brown and the beef reaches your desired level of doneness. Use a meat thermometer to monitor the internal temperature.</li>
        <li><strong>Rest and Serve </strong> - Allow the Beef Wellington to rest for about 10 minutes before slicing it into thick portions. Serve with your choice of sauce, such as a mushroom sauce or red wine reduction.</li>

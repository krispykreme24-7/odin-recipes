    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>Beef Wellington is a classic British dish that consists of a tender beef fillet (usually coated with a layer of pâté or mushroom duxelles) that is encased in puff pastry and baked until golden brown. The dish is often flavored with herbs and sometimes wrapped in slices of prosciutto or parma ham before being wrapped in the pastry. The result is a delicious, luxurious, and indulgent entrée that combines the rich flavors of beef with the buttery, flaky goodness of puff pastry. It's typically served in thick slices and is often accompanied by a rich mushroom sauce or red wine reduction. Beef Wellington is known for its elegant presentation and is a popular choice for special occasions and holiday dinners.</p>
